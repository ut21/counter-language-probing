1) linear probes:
    a) change evaluation to be on test
    b) make control task - the current task is correct i think
    c) ablate for selectivity across probing classifier complexity

2) non linear prboes:
    a) change evaluation to be on test
    b) make control task - the current task is correct i think
    c) ablate for selectivity across probing classifier complexity

3) other tasks:
    a) Dyck/polish notation arithmetic train the model and then test for stack
